1. myFirstMalware.exe

An executable that prints an ascii squirtle and you need to bypass a seires of anti-debugging checks to receive a jpg from that contains the key in binary

2. labbytime.exe

3. labyrINth.exe

An executable that requires being run in a vmware vm that has a variety of checks for host system information and requiring patching or modifying your environment to pass and get the key.
