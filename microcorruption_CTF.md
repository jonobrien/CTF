microcorruption solutions

these challenges contain elements that are semi-randomized and thus cannot be c+p so here are some solutions I have and possibly some explanations.


#### new orleans
live dump addr 2400 -> p,<P?A:

check_password compares the input with that addr




#### cusco

AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDFD


#### johannesburg

buffer addr is semi-random, replace accordingly, then addr for unlock()


#### ReykjavÃ­k
the compare address, check for endianness, enter in hex
